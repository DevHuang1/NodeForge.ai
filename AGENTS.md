# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues on `DevHuang1/NodeForge.ai` via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root, created lazily. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
